## Customer Impersonation Workflow

### Prerequisites

1. Valid user ID (MongoDB ObjectId format)
2. Customer impersonation mode enabled
3. Proper authentication setup

### Usage Instructions

#### 1. Enable Customer Mode

When starting a conversation, specify:

```
"I want to impersonate customer with ID: [USER_ID]"
```

#### 2. Available Actions in Customer Mode

- Browse products and variants
- View own cart and orders
- Add/remove items from cart
- Complete checkout process
- Track own shipments
- Update own profile information
- Add/update addresses and payment methods

#### 3. Restricted Actions

The following actions are automatically blocked:

- Viewing other customers' data
- Accessing admin analytics
- Modifying system-wide settings
- Creating/deleting products
- Managing other users' orders

### Security Measures

#### Data Isolation

- All queries automatically filter by impersonated user ID
- Cross-user data access is prevented
- Sensitive admin operations are disabled

#### Validation Rules

- User ID must be valid MongoDB ObjectId
- User must exist in the system
- All operations are scoped to the impersonated user

#### Audit Trail

- All impersonation activities are logged
- User ID is tracked in all operations
- Access attempts to restricted tools are recorded

## Implementation

### Workflow Configuration

The customer impersonation workflow includes:

1. User ID validation
2. Tool filtering based on access level
3. Automatic data scoping
4. Security logging

### Error Handling

- Invalid user ID: Clear error message with format requirements
- Non-existent user: User not found error
- Unauthorized access: Access denied message
- System errors: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

## Best Practices

### For Customer Support

1. Always verify customer identity before impersonation
2. Use impersonation only for legitimate support purposes
3. Document the reason for impersonation
4. End impersonation session when support is complete

### For Testing

1. Use test user accounts for development
2. Never impersonate real customer accounts in testing
3. Clean up test data after testing sessions
4. Use dedicated test environments

### For Development

1. Implement proper access controls
2. Log all impersonation activities
3. Regular security audits
4. Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid User ID**: Ensure ObjectId format (24 hex characters)
2. **Access Denied**: Check if user exists and is active
3. **Tool Not Available**: Verify customer mode is enabled
4. **Data Not Found**: Confirm user has the requested data
