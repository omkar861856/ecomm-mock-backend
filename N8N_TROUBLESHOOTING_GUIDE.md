# N8N E-commerce AI Agent Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **SOLUTION SUMMARY**

The issue you were experiencing was due to **incomplete workflow configuration**. Your original workflow was missing essential components and had incomplete tool connections.

## ✅ **FIXED WORKFLOW FILES**

1. **`n8n-workflow-final.json`** - Complete workflow with all 42 tools properly connected
2. **`merge-tools-workflow.js`** - Script to merge tools into workflow

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS WRONG**

### **Original Issues:**

1. **Missing Core Nodes**: Your workflow was missing:

   - AI Agent node with proper configuration
   - MongoDB Chat Memory
   - OpenAI Chat Model
   - Chat Trigger

2. **Incomplete Connections**: Only 3 tools were connected instead of all 42

3. **Missing System Prompt**: The AI Agent lacked the comprehensive system prompt with proper formatting and all tool descriptions

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION**

### **Step 1: Import the Complete Workflow**

1. Open n8n
2. Import `n8n-workflow-final.json`
3. Verify all 46 nodes are loaded
4. Check that all 45 connections are established
5. **NEW**: Verify the AI Agent has the updated system prompt with proper formatting

### **Step 2: Verify Tool Connections**

All these tools should be connected to the AI Agent:

- ✅ Get All Products
- ✅ Get Product by ID
- ✅ Create Product
- ✅ Update Product
- ✅ Delete Product
- ✅ Get Product Variants
- ✅ Get All Users

### **Step 3: Configure Credentials**

Make sure these credentials are set up:

1. **OpenAI API** - For the language model
2. **MongoDB** - For chat memory

### **Step 4: Test the Workflow**

1. Activate the workflow
2. Send a test message: "Show me all products"
3. Verify the AI Agent can access and use the tools

## 🛠️ **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: "Tool not found" errors**

**Solution**: Ensure all HTTP Request Tool nodes are connected to the AI Agent via `ai_tool` connections.

### **Issue 2: AI Agent not responding**

**Solution**: Check that:

- OpenAI Chat Model is connected to AI Agent
- MongoDB Chat Memory is connected to AI Agent
- Chat Trigger is connected to AI Agent

### **Issue 3: Tools not executing**

**Solution**: Verify:

- All tool URLs point to `http://localhost:3000`
- Your e-commerce API server is running
- API endpoints are accessible

### **Issue 4: Memory not working**

**Solution**: Check:

- MongoDB credentials are correct
- Database name is `ecomm_mock`
- MongoDB instance is running

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### **1. Check Node Connections**

```bash
# In n8n, verify each tool node has:
# - Input: ai_tool connection from AI Agent
# - Output: ai_tool connection to AI Agent
```

### **2. Test Individual Tools**

```bash
# Test each HTTP Request Tool individually:
# 1. Right-click on tool node
# 2. Select "Execute Node"
# 3. Check for errors in execution
```

### **3. Verify API Endpoints**

```bash
# Test your e-commerce API:
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products
```

### **4. Check n8n Logs**

```bash
# Look for errors in n8n execution logs:
# - Connection errors
# - Authentication failures
# - Tool execution failures
```

## 📊 **WORKFLOW STRUCTURE**

```
Chat Trigger → AI Agent ← OpenAI Chat Model
                    ↓
              MongoDB Memory
                    ↓
            [42 HTTP Request Tools]
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

- [ ] All 46 nodes imported
- [ ] All 45 connections established
- [ ] OpenAI credentials configured
- [ ] MongoDB credentials configured
- [ ] E-commerce API server running on localhost:3000
- [ ] Workflow activated
- [ ] Test message sent successfully

## 📞 **SUPPORT**

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check n8n execution logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify API server status** with health check endpoint
3. **Test individual tools** to isolate the problem
4. **Check credential configuration** in n8n settings

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

Once properly configured, the AI Agent should:

- ✅ Respond to chat messages
- ✅ Access all 42 e-commerce tools
- ✅ Maintain conversation memory
- ✅ Execute API calls successfully
- ✅ Provide helpful e-commerce assistance
